It's particularly good at surviving configuration changes when Android destroys your Activity and Views and replaces them with new ones.\r\n\r\n## What is MVVM?\r\nModel-View-ViewModel is an architectural approach used to abstract the state and behavior of a view, which allows us to separate the development of the UI from the business logic. This is accomplished by the introduction of a ViewModel, whose responsibility is to expose the data objects of a model and handle any of the applications logic involved in the display of a view.\r\n\r\nThis approach (MVVM) is made up of three core components, each with its own distinct and separate role:\r\n- **Model** - Data model containing business and validation logic\r\n- **View** - Defines the structure, layout and appearance of a view on screen\r\n- **ViewModel** - Acts a link between the View and Model, dealing with any view logic\r\n\r\n## Implementation with android-mvvm library",
